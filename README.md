# DevOps-Learning-CI-CD
Repository containing topics I learnt in the CoderCo CICD Module.

## What is CICD?
- CI: Continuous Integration - The practice of automatically integrating code changes from multiple contributors into a shared repository several times a day.
- CD: 
    - Continuous Deployment - Automatically releasing every change that passes all stages of the production pipeline
    - Continuous Delivery - Ensuring the software can be reliably released at any time.
    
## Why is CICD important?
- Faster Delivery: due to automating processes and delivery
- Improved Quality: due to continuously testing and integrating code
- Reduced Risk: due to smaller changes being tested and integrated rather than large changes
- Better Collaboration: Fewer conflicts and better communication
